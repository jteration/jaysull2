    This is the first paragraph. I'm writing the first paragraph so I can see
    what it looks like on the blog page and style it. Let's make the first
    paragraph a decent length. Maybe 5 sentences, or 6 even. Should I write out
    five and six? Or leave it as 5 and 6. Hit that like button and comment below
    on how to write out digits in this context.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the second paragraph. I'm not sure if I want to write two or three
    paragraphs. Or is it 2 or 3 paragraphs? It will be obvious to you because
    you will see the number of paragraphs and be able to tell at a glance if
    there are two or three or more or fewer.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the third paragraph, or is it the 3rd paragraph. I'm watching a
    video on conical burr grinders. I want to get a nice one but they are
    exensive and I want to save money. I already ordered some clothes today that
    I didn't really need but I kind of needed.
  </p>
  <p>This will be the last paragraph. I'll keep it short and sweet.</p>
